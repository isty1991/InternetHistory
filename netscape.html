    <p>In September 1993,Marc Andreessen along with Jim Clark invented a browser called Mosaic and they turned it into a business venture.
        In 1994,Microsoft built its own network called Microsoft network.By 1990s,about 90% of the world was using computer with Microsoft
        installed in it.Microsoft was a tech giant then.Mosaic saw its ending days when a new web browser called Netscape was launched.
        It was launched on 13 October 1994 and got a million downloads pretty fast. Microsoft eventually bought Mosaic.
        Which turned into a new web browser called Internet Explorer.Netscape changed the web browser experience for everyone.
        Originally it was used by geeks or computer scientists but now even common people started using it extensively because it was convenient.
        The sudden popularity of Netscape made Microsoft to release its own web browser,Internet Explorer on December 7,1995.
        In june 1995,Microsoft and Netscape sat for a meeting.It is considered as one of the most controversial meeting in Silicon Valley.
        According to Netscape microsoft offered them $1 million dollars for the entire company.However,the deal did not go through.
        Within a year of existence,Netscape went public, and it was considered as one of the biggest IPO released.Jim Clarc who had invested $5
        million dollars was now sitting on a fortune of nearly $663 million dollars when Netscape went public.The competition between these two
        companies was brutal.However,it came to an end when Microsoft decided to release I4 version of Internet Explorer for free. With the launch
        of new version,Microsoft now had around 80% of the market share.Netscape was sold to AOL.This was the end of the browser war.
        In 1998,Gary Rebak,CEO of Netscape sued Microsoft stating that Microsoft prevented users to use Netscape as the web browser.
        Microsoft was found guilty and the judge of the federal court ordered Microsoft to split in two.
        Stock market haywire that day as the value of the company went down by $30 billions overnight. United States court of appeals rescind
        the order as the order to break the company into two was regarded as a harsh punishment and as Microsoft had broken the law systematically
        they thought it was really harsh on Bill Gates and Microsoft to have such a harsh punishment.
