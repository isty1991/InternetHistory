        <h2 class="section-header">Amazon Launch</h2>
        <p>Jeff Bezos launched Amazon in 1995 and Pierre launched Ebay in 1988. They pioneered online shopping. After the internet was
            open to the public it took only 4 years to reach 50 million users. Silicon Chip and McCalf law were the two reasons why the
            internet reached such a large population. In 1997, Amazon went public valued at 2 billion dollars. One problem Amazon face was
            to convince its customer to provide them with credit card numbers. Martin Hellman, Ralph Merkle, and Whitfield Diffie at
            Stanford University in 1976 invented the public key cryptography to support online commerce. It was a safer way to send
            credentials that were important to the users.</p>

        <h2 class="section-header">The .com Bubble Burst!</h2>
        <p>People, investors were blindly investing in companies that had .com attached to it. Day traders came into the picture:they
            would buy stocks in the morning and sell them by evening. The source of their information came from chat rooms and watching
            CNBC. This was the starting of the dot com bubble. Investors and wall street knew it was a bubble, but they still bet thinking
            that even if one company works it would be profitable for them. Companies started using fibre optics. In 1999, there were 250
            companies that launched their IPOEbay was 21 billion dollars in 1999. Alan greenspan chairman of federal bank decided to cool
            things down. He was determined to put the bubble to the end, and he did cool things down. That’s when NASDAQ fell 25% in a single
            point. Amazon and ebay survived because their principle was based on deep understanding of their customers and their customers came first.
            Andy Grove actually said that the bubble was a good thing to happen because the infrastructure that was built to support so many companies
            was completed in the boom time of say 5 years else it would have taken them at least 15 years.</p>

        <h2 class="section-header">Advent of Youtube</h2>
        <p>Chad Hurley,Kevin Rose and Jay Anderson were the leaders of the web 2.0.Chad founded YouTube whereas Kevin and Jay found Digg.
            Traditional TV network only showed what they wanted to show.With the advent of YouTube anyone could upload any videos.
            WIth Digg people could choose which kind of news could be on their homepage.It was nearly the same time when Mark Zuckerberg
            also invented Facebook based on mapping out the relations of an individual.In mid 1900s,if you wanted to listen to music you
            needed to buy a CD which was crappy at times.This whole process was tedious and expensive at the same time.
            People like Justin Frankel,co-founder of Winamp,Cabel Sasser emerged.They used MP3 technology which suppressed music file size
            so that they could be sent to anyone.At the same time Jay Smith of EMI records teamed up with IBM and concluded that no one
            wanted to buy CD and burn it.This was a really helpful insight. Bigshots of music industry disapproved sending of music through
            Internet because their revenue would be disturbed by the new technology.</p>

    <h2 class="section-header">Napster</h2>
    <p>It was in the early 2000s when Napster was found by Shawn Fanning. Napster was used to send music from one host to another
       through the internet for free.He did not launch the product in the market but shared to his friends and it was such a
       disruptive product that his friends could not resist it to share it to their friends.In a few weeks,Napster got around 10K
       downloads and in a few months there were around 1 million downloads.This annoyed many people like Hilary Rosen who was the head of recording
       industry,artists like Dr.Dre and Metallica as their revenue was dependent on the number of CDs sold.
       Metallica’s drummer Lars Ulrich then went to Napster’s office and demanded to ban 300 thousands user from the application as they listened to
       Metallica music illegally.Hilary Rosen then sued Napster in RIAA and Napster story came to an end in July 2001.However,Napster pioneered
       music through internet.This encouraged Steve Jobs to create Apple Music.</p>
