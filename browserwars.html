    <h2 class="section-header">Mosaic</h2>
    <p>In September 1993,Marc Andreessen along with Jim Clark invented a browser called Mosaic, and they turned it into a business venture.
        Clark and Andreessen planned to further this popularization process and to capitalize on it by marketing a commercial-quality Web browser,
        Web-server software, development tools, and related services. In October 1994 the company made available on its Website the first version
        of Navigator, their new browser. By utilizing the shareware distribution model of “try before you buy” (except in education, where the program
        was free), Navigator was an immediate success: over the following 12 months some eight million copies were downloaded.
        Because Navigator connected to Netscape’s Website by default (and later because of various services offered by the company), netscape.com
        became one of the busiest sites on the Web. The company’s rise to prominence triggered a dispute with the University of Illinois, which had
        trademarked the Mosaic name and designated another company as master licensee for the NCSA Mosaic software. As part of an out-of-court settlement,
        Mosaic Communications changed its name to Netscape Communications.</p>

    <h2 class="section-header">Netscape vs. Microsoft</h2>
    <p>Same year, Microsoft built its own network called Microsoft network. By 1990s, about 90% of the world was using computer with Microsoft
        installed in it. Microsoft was a tech giant then. Mosaic saw its ending days when a new web browser called Netscape was launched.
        It was launched on 13 October 1994 and got a million downloads pretty fast. Microsoft eventually bought Mosaic.
        Which turned into a new web browser called Internet Explorer. Netscape changed the web browser experience for everyone.
        The sudden popularity of Netscape made Microsoft to release its own web browser,Internet Explorer on December 7,1995.
        As a result, Netscape’s market share among browser users, previously estimated at over 80 percent, began to decline.
        In june 1995,Microsoft and Netscape sat for a meeting. It is considered as one of the most controversial meeting in Silicon Valley.
        According to Netscape microsoft offered them $1 million dollars for the entire company. However,the deal did not go through.
        Within a year of existence,Netscape went public, and it was considered as one of the biggest IPO released. Jim Clarc who had invested $5
        million dollars was now sitting on a fortune of nearly $663 million dollars when Netscape went public. The competition between these two
        companies was brutal.
        In early 1998 it reported slowing growth and its first quarterly operating loss ever. In an effort to regain market momentum, it declared Navigator
        and Communicator completely free and even made the programs’ source code available to other developers for customizing and enhancement.
        However, it came to an end when Microsoft decided to release I4 version of Internet Explorer for free. With the launch of new version,Microsoft
        now had around 80% of the market share. Netscape was sold to AOL. This was the end of the browser war.
        In 1998,Gary Rebak, CEO of Netscape sued Microsoft stating that Microsoft prevented users to use Netscape as the web browser.
        Microsoft was found guilty and the judge of the federal court ordered Microsoft to split in two.</p>
