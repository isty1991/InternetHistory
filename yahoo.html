        <h2 class="section-header">Netscape led the way</h2>
        <p>......Though Netscape lost the browser war,it was a pioneer of web browsers and this inspired many companies like Google,
            Yahoo which replaced Microsoft’s Internet Explorer.
        <p>Jerry Yang and David Feiler were two students from Stanford University who invented Yahoo in 1994. They made
            documentation on how to use the Internet and many people flocked to that website. As their Website grew, both in size
            and in the number of links from which it was composed, the number of people who used the site also increased dramatically.
            Thus, Yang and Filo began spending more and more time on their new hobby, gradually converting the homemade list into a customized
            database that users could search to locate Websites related to specific interests. The database itself was originally located on
            Yang's Stanford student computer workstation, named "akebono," while the search engine was located on Filo's computer, "konishiki"
            (the two computers were named after legendary Hawaiian sumo wrestlers). As for the transformation of the database's name from "Jerry's
            Guide to the World Wide Web" to "Yahoo!," the two men became bored with the original tag and set about to change it late one night
            while bumming around in their trailer on the Stanford campus. Looking to mimic the phrase/acronym "Yet Another Compiler Compiler"
            (YACC), a favorite among Unix aficionados, Yang and Filo came up with "Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle" (YAHOO).
            Browsing through the online edition of Webster's dictionary around midnight, they decided that the general definition of a yahoo--rude
            and uncouth--was fitting. Yang was known for his foul language, and Filo was described as being blunt. The two considered themselves
            to be a couple of major yahoos, and thus the name which would soon become a household brand was born. Michael Mortiz,venture
            capitalist at sequoia capital invested in yahoo in its early stages. Companies like Google and Yahoo knew how to make billions of
            dollars on the internet:ADVERTISING.Yahoo started putting ads on their website just to make revenue.Joe Kraus,
            co-founder of the company called Excite, was the rival of Yahoo. Their search engine was much more sophisticated than
            that of Yahoo. It was query driven.With all the advertising revenue coming in, the founders of all the search engines
            actually lost their vision. Users had to actually try various permutations and combinations just to get the desired
            output.This was the beginning of the end. This is also when Google was born.</p>

        <h2 class="section-header">Arrival of Google</h2>
        <p>Larry page and Sergey Brin were the founders of Google. Google was built on how many clicks a page was getting.
            The more the number of clicks the more the priority. In yahoo and Excite people were always redirected to the other
            web page. They used that model to make Google and directed the user directly to that web page making it really fast
            and more convenient. Andy Bechtolsheim, Michael Mortiz and John Doear were few of the investors who had invested in
            Google.Google were not against ads but wanted in a much sophisticated way. So they copied the idea from Bill Gross
            founder of Idealab. Bill coined the word KEYWORD. In 1988,he launched a company called OVERTURE based on keywords
            and links.It was an instant success.Larry and Sergei met Bill to try to find a way. They left without making a deal and
            they soon came up with google adwords which was really identical to overture. To compensate they gave bill gross stocks
            of google which made him really happy.On august 19,2004, Google went public . Google’s expansion, fueled largely by keyword-based
            Web advertising, provided it with a sound footing to compete for dominance in new Web services. One of these was the delivery of
            video content. In January 2005 Google launched Google Video, which enabled individuals to search the close-captioned text from
            television broadcasts. A few months later Google began accepting user-submitted videos, with submitters setting the prices for
            others to download and view the videos. In January 2006 Google Video Store opened, featuring premium content from traditional
            media companies such as CBS Corporation (television shows) and Sony Corporation (movies). In June 2006 Google began offering premium
            content for free but with ads. In 5 years the company made nearly 5 billions in revenue.</p>
